Conclusion
In this project, we successfully built a Logistic Regression model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using a variety of features. Through careful data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering — including extracting titles from names, creating family size variables, and handling missing values — we improved the model’s predictive power.The logistic regression model achieved a solid accuracy, demonstrating that features like passenger class, gender, age group, and family size play a significant role in survival outcomes. While the model performs reasonably well, there is room for improvement by exploring more advanced algorithms, fine-tuning hyperparameters, or incorporating additional feature engineering.Overall, this project highlights the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in building effective predictive models, especially on real-world datasets with missing or messy data.
